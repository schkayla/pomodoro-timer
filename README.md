# [pomodoro timer](https://schkayla.github.io/pomodoro-timer/ "pomodoro timer")

I started this project with the goal of connecting a pomodoro-like timer to my Spotify playlists, so that I could pick a playlist, then select how long I wanted to work and break for. Then the music would play while I was working, and pause while on break. So essentially, I could follow the music cues and not have to watch the timer. 

I looked into the Spotify API, but am still figuring out how to make it work with the timer, so in the meantime, I selected a few YouTube music livestreams that play/pause on cue according to the time entered on the form. The timer will loop between work and break time until you click the stop button, and you can use the pause button to pause the music at any time and resume your session later.
